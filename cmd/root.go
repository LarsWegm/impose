This tool automatically scans the given Docker Compose

You can use head or inline comments for the image keyword in the Docker Compose file to add annotations.
The following annotations are available:
  impose:ignore     ignores the image for updates
  impose:minor      only checks for minor version updates
  impose:patch      only checks for patch version updates
  impose:warnMajor  warns if major version has changed
  impose:warnMinor  warns if minor version has changed (including major version changes)
  impose:warnPatch  warns if patch version has changed (including major and minor version changes)
  impose:warnAll    warns if the version string has changed in any way (including version suffix)`,
